# SIMple Mechanics
[![](https://gitlab.com/mkhan45/physics-v2/badges/master/pipeline.svg?key_text=build&style=flat-square)](https://gitlab.com/mkhan45/physics-v2/-/pipelines)

Educational physics sim that uses graphs, FBDs, and other helpful stuff to teach physics. Also see my [gravity sim](https://github.com/mkhan45/gravity-sim-v2)
